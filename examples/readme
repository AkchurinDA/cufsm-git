CUFSM matlab files and scripts provided in examples folder.

Analysis performed on earlier version of CUFSM (circa 2006), some modifications may be needed to run on recent version.
In particular the change of routine strip.m to stripmain.m is likely to cause issues with scripts, also options
in the plotting routines have changed, so also likely to cause some issues.
