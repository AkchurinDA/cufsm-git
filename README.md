# cufsm git
This is the github repo for the cross-section elastic buckling analysis tool cufsm.

CUFSM - is the Constrained and Unconstrained Finite Strip Method - and provides elastic buckling for member cross-sections as utilized by structural engineers. The method employs the finite strip method, a variant of the finite element method. The implementation allows for general end boundary conditions through series approximations or provides the signatude curve analysis aligned with classical buckling solutions with idealized end conditions.

The code is written in matlab, but compiled version using matlab application compiler are provided in releases.

The website www.ce.jhu.edu/cufsm and www.ce.jhu.edu/bschafer provide more information on the software.

For researchers, students, or anyone with access to matlab, highly recommended to use the source code directly in matlab, this is much more stable and manageable. For others, the standalone applications are provided.
