This is the github repo for the cross-section elastic buckling analysis tool cufsm.

The code is written in matlab, but compiled version using matlab application compiler are provided in releases.

The website www.ce.jhu.edu/cufsm and www.ce.jhu.edu/bschafer provide more information on the software.

For researchers, students, or anyone with access to matlab, highly recommended to use the source code directly in matlab, this is much more stable and manageable. For others, the standalone applications are provided.
