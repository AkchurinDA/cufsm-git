# CUFSM

This is the GitHub repository for the cross-section elastic buckling analysis tool CUFSM written in MATLAB.

## Description

CUFSM - is the Constrained and Unconstrained Finite Strip Method - and provides elastic buckling for member cross-sections as utilized by structural engineers. The method employs the finite strip method, a variant of the finite element method. The implementation allows for general end boundary conditions through series approximations or provides the signature curve analysis aligned with classical buckling solutions with idealized end conditions.

## Installation

The latest version of the software is available for download on [the latest release page](https://github.com/thinwalled/cufsm-git/releases). The software is provided as both (1) the MATLAB source code and (2) compiled standalone applications. For researchers, students, or anyone with access to MATLAB, it is highly recommended to use the source code directly in MATLAB, this is much more stable and manageable.

## License
